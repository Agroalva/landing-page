# Convex + Better Auth Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the implementation plan split into 11 phases.

## Phase Overview

- **Phase 0** - Baseline & Environment: Set up Convex project and environment variables
- **Phase 1** - Better Auth in Convex: Install packages and configure Convex backend
- **Phase 2** - Client Provider and Auth Client: Set up Expo client integration
- **Phase 3** - Auth UI Flows: Implement sign in/sign up screens and route protection
- **Phase 4** - Data Model: Define database schema for all entities
- **Phase 5** - Convex Functions: Implement secure backend functions
- **Phase 6** - Wire Expo Screens: Connect existing screens to Convex
- **Phase 7** - Realtime Presence: Add online/typing indicators (optional)
- **Phase 8** - Media Storage: Implement file uploads (optional but recommended)
- **Phase 9** - Hardening: Add validation, authorization, and rate limiting
- **Phase 10** - DevX, Testing, and Release: Documentation, tests, and deployment

## Execution Order

Phases should be completed sequentially from 0-6. Phases 7-8 are optional enhancements that can be done in parallel. Phase 9 should be completed before Phase 10.

## Quick Start

1. Read `phase-0-baseline-environment.md` and complete setup
2. Follow phases in order, checking off tasks as you complete them
3. Test after each phase before moving to the next
4. Complete optional phases based on project needs

## Notes

- Keep `convex dev` running throughout implementation
- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
- Adjust tasks based on your specific requirements
